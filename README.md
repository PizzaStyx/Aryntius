# Aryntius Config Files
This is a repository of practically every custom config for the server.
Do note that certain values such as default configs and folders generated by the plugin have not been included.

A list of plugins used can be found below:
- BookMenu
- BossShopPro (Although the free one works too)
- Citizens
- CitizensCMD
- CitizensText
- Crackshot
- CrackshotPlus
- InfernalMobs (Deprecated and only used for set bonuses)
- MythicMobs
- RandomCommand
- TreasureChest

Note: TreasureChest's config files are generated automatically using the in-game configuration tool and thus none are included in this repository.
