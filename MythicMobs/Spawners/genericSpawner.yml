genericSpawner:
### There are over 1100 spawners on Aryntius, the vast majority
### of which are clones of each other. So uploading them would
### be pointless.
###
### Instead, I've included an example spawner that behaves exactly
### like any spawner on Aryntius would. Boss spawners work the same
### way but have a longer timer and a MaxMobs value of 1.
