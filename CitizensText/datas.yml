    0: Greetings, mortal. You have many questions, but I will only answer the most
      important one of them.
    1: This place you see is a vision--a world where you failed to destroy the Shadewalker.
    2: None now live where the town once stood, only barren wastes and hordes of undead.
    3: But all actions have consequences. And in time you, too, shall reap what you
      sow.

    0: It's about damn time you've arrived! We've lost far too many men to this outbreak,
      all turned mad in the lower mines.
    1: This all started when we unearthed an entrance... Seemed like a burial chamber
      or something. None of us dared to venture too far within.
    2: But I'm sure you can make some sense of it. You are a kingdom agent, after
      all.
    3: Also, feel free to take supplies from the chests strewn about these caverns.
      Better to have them in your hands than an undead horde's.
    4: Now go! We don't have all day to save the village!
