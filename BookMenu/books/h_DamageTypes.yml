    - ""
    - "Damage types were introduced in 2.1.5 and highly modify the effects of combat."
    - ""
    - "Damage is displayed in minecraft hearts (&c1.0❤&0) on all items and in holograms above enemies during combat."

    - "&8&lPhysical Damage"
    - ""
    - "Most weapons deal physical damage, which can be mitigated by both normal hearts, golden hearts, armor, and resistance."
    - ""
    - "This includes magic items and enchanted gear."
  4:
    - "&8&lChaos Damage"
    - ""
    - "Also known as true damage, chaos damage bypasses all armor and resistance levels."
    - ""
    - "It cannot be mitigated or reflected, and it directly damages the target's maximum health."
  5:
    - "Example:"
    - ""
    - "Physical Hit - &c250.0❤"
    - "&c10.0❤ &0after reduction"
    - ""
    - "Chaos Hit - &c40.0❤"
    - "&c40.0❤ &0after reduction"
    - ""
    - "As such, Chaos damage is incredibly powerful against armored enemies such as bosses."
  6:
    - "However, its effect is much weaker against enemies with higher levels of maximum health."
    - ""
    - "Notably, Chaos damage can also bypass vanilla Minecraft invincibility frames and stack without restrictions."
  7:
    - "&8&lDamage Reduction"
    - ""
    - "Damage taken can be severely mitigated with armor enchants and resistance."
    - ""
    - "Resistance adds 20% reduction per level."
    - ""
    - "I.e. Resistance IV = 4x20 = 80% damage reduction."
  8:
    - "Armor adds up to 80% damage reduction based on the sum of the enchant level."
    - ""
    - "E.g. Protection XV on one item is the same as having Protection V on 3 items."
    - ""
    - "Enchants are capped at a sum of 20 (XX) in Vanilla Minecraft."
  9:
    - "When combined, the maximum possible damage reduction attainable is 96%, meaning you take 1/20 of all incoming damage."
    - ""
    - "However, achieving Resistance V (100% damage reduction) is possible with temporary buffs."
  10:
    - "&8&lGolden Hearts"
    - ""
    - "Also known as Energy Shield (ES), golden hearts work exactly like Absorption in Vanilla Minecraft."
    - ""
    - "These function as normal hearts but cannot regenerate or be healed."
  11:
    - "Golden hearts do not stack, and instead replace their values based on the item's tier."
    - ""
    - "E.g. if a Legendary item gives 10.0 gold hearts while an Exalted item gives 20.0, you will only have 10.0 gold hearts with both equipped."
  12:
    - "Notably, players are immune to knockback while they have gold hearts."
    - ""
    - "However, chaos and bleed damage can bypass gold hearts entirely."
